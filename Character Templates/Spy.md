###  Spy 250 points

Spies are masters of intrigue, infiltration and manipulation.  The spy template represents a sort of super-agent, a cinematic spy who win men with a winsome smile, look great in a cat-suit while slipping, undetected, into an enemy installation, and then deftly plant tracers on her enemy or bug her target's communications.

Spies *do not* specialize in combat (stealthy combat and assassination is the purview of the Assassin), but they can fight, if pressed.  Instead, the spy focuses on gaining access to information in one form or another.  Spies must specialize. Those who focus on *Craftiness* excel at the physical access to information, such as infiltrating locations by means of stealth and guile, and those who want to expand this focus can take up the Ghost upgrade.  Those who focus on *Impersonation* excel at the manipulation of others, convincing people that they are someone that they are not.  Those who want to expand on this focus can take the Master of Diguises upgrade.  Finally, any spy has access to decent technological toys, and those who wish to really focus on them can take the Hacker upgrade.

Like most core templates, you should decide if your spy currently serves with an organization or if she works freelance.
