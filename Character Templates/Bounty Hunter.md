###  Bounty Hunter 250 points

The Bounty Hunter goes where the law men of the Core refuse to go: into the outer reaches of the Rim.  There, she must navigate through strange stars, use gossip, research and intuition to locate her prey and then use her supreme prowess to bring that target in, dead or alive.

The Bounty Hunter can easily be a master of pistol combat, or a highly competent unarmed combatant, or a mixture of two.  Skills like fast-draw and perks like quick sheath allows her to transition from one to the other quickly. Her other primary skillset is locating people in a primarily urban environment: Wretched hives of scum and villainy are her preferred stomping grounds.

Bounty Hunters who wish to enjoy combat competency with heavier weapons can take the Heavy Hunter upgrade.  Some bounty hunters don't look the part, which they use to their advantage by using their good looks to set their prey at ease for when they get close; for this sort of bounty hunter, use the Femme Fatale upgrade.  Finally, once a Bounty Hunter has found her prey, she needs to catch him.  Most bounty hunters specialize in handling a ship, as they need to get around the galaxy, but for those who have mastered speeders, take the Contragravity Chaser upgrade.
