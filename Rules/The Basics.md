# The Basics

## Introduction to the Psi-Wars Ruleset

Psi-Wars uses the GURPS Action series as its core framework.  While it may be possible to run Psi-Wars without any material from that series, most of these rules draw heavily on **GURPS Action 2: Exploits** and will not repeat any material found therein, thus this work is highly recommended to anyone running Psi-Wars.

Specifically, Psi-Wars makes use of **BAD**: Basic Abstract Difficulty.  It also uses Complementary Skills and Teamwork found on pages 4-5 of **GURPS Action 2: Exploits**

### BAD PSI

Psionic powers offer heroes access to a unique approach to problems, one that's generally, but *not always* superior to a mundane approach.  For example, picking a lock with telekinesis tends to be easier than picking a lock with a lockpick, *unless* your opponent explicitly defended against psychic attacks, in which case, psychic abilities might be surprisingly difficult to use.

For this reason, Psi-Wars recommends having two BAD modifiers: the mundane one, and a "BAD PSI" modifier which modifies psionic skill rolls.  By default, BAD PSI is half-bad: against an opponent that's savvy about psychic abilities, BAD and BAD PSI might be equal; against an opponent who is better at dealing with psionic powers than they are with mundane threats (cults, for example), BAD PSI might *exceed* BAD!

When it comes to Complementary rules, as a general rule, psychic powers as a complementary roll double the bonus they offer; eg a +2, rather than +1 bonus, unless the psychic effect is nigh-miraculous in its usefulness (**Precognition** and **Gambling**, **Telepathy** and **Interrogation** etc), in which case it adds +4 on either a success or critical success.

### **It Is Your DESTINY!**

Psi-Wars uses *Impulse Buys* as the core mechanic of the **Destiny** trait. GMs running Psi-Wars should consider allowing players to spend their own character points to power Impulse Buys.  See "Influencing Success Rolls" on B347.

If you have a copy of **GURPS Power-Ups 5: Impulse Buys**, consider including the following options:

- Buying Success (PU5 4)
- Cursing Mooks (PU5 6)
- Buying Effect (PU5 6)
- Player Guidance (PU5 7)
- Flesh Wound (but not Second Wind) (PU5 10)
- Miraculous Recovery  (PU5 11)
- Character Point-Powered Abilities (PU5 13)

### Additional Options

**The Ham Clause:** GURPS Action introduced the Ham Clause (**GURPS Action 1: Heroes** page 20 *or* **Pyramid #3/70 "Fourth Edition Festival"** page 15) and using it simplifies a lot of the stranger traits in the game, especially for aliens.

**Quick and Dirty Modifiers:** GURPS Dungeon Fantasy recommends "quick and dirty modifiers" (**GURPS Dungeon Fantasy 2: Dungeons** page 7 *or* **Pyramid #3/70 "Fourth Edition Festival"** page 16).  Consider using it instead of BAD in situations where characters aren't facing an organization (such as just trying to handle the wilderness or dealing with locals) *or* as a supplement to BAD.

# Additional GURPS Action Basics

"The Basics" from **GURPS Action 2: Exploits**  can be taken *as is* with the following commentary; note that space travel is handled elsewhere.

##  Getting the Ball Rolling

In addition to all the noted suggestions, characters with **Visions** or any form of **Communion** can be fed information directly by the GM.  Visions can come at any time appropriate for the character who has visions, while the GM needn’t wait for a player to draw on Communion to gain a vision of some important quest.  Instead, the GM can actively give a vision to the target via his connection with Communion, though this most commonly comes during a peaceful moment of meditation (say, when building up his Meditative Energy Reserves) or in a dream (or nightmare, in the case of **Broken Communion**).

## Travel

Psi-Wars uses slightly different vehicles than the real world, thus will require some different specialties when *At the Wheel*, such as **Driving (Legged, Repulsorlift or Tracked)**, or **Piloting (Starships)**.

## Beans, Bullets and Batteries

These rules still apply, but note that Psi-Wars uses *super-science* power cells, which means that a given power cell is *already* “five power cells.”  In short, ignore all power requirements until such time as the GM states that the PCs are cut off, at which point it may become worthwhile to count shots.

## Squad SOP

### Communications

Psi-Wars has, broadly, three forms of communication.  First, it has *planetary networks* (UT39), which means that if one is in an urban area and can access a console, they can “place a call” to someone use, usually with at least a moving image of that person, but more often a small hologram.  Second, Psi-Wars features a generic comm system that works like radio for the purposes of interference (*Static*, on page 8 of Action 2) but as gravity-ripple (UT45) for purposes of range and data-transfer rate: Even relatively small communicators can talk to a ship in orbit, and send real-time 3D holographic imagery.  Finally, very large comm systems (such as those found on ships) can use FTL communication systems.  These travel *instantly* and a range limited to within the galaxy itself (though, naturally, huge distances are more likely to suffer more interference thanks to hyperspace storms, pulsars, nebulas, and the like).

Telepaths can bypass technological countermeasures (like jamming systems) with **Telesend**.  With the **Broadcast** technique, the character can send a message to everyone in the party.  Combined wither with the **Full Communion** technique or **Telerecieve** (especially with Multiplicity), a telepath can act as the hub for a fully psionic communication network.

### Subtlety

**Mind-Clouding** grants its power level as a bonus to all **Stealth** rolls.  It also adds its level to all **Shadowing** rolls for the purposes of *Man in the Crowd*.  **TK-Grab** is *invisible*.  Targets cannot see it at all until it has begun interacting with something and begun moving it around.  For both cases, use Detecting Psi on page 11 of Psionic Powers.

*Tailing:* **Telescan** lets you keep tabs on your target in a larger crowd and grants a +2 to all **Shadowing** rolls.  **Mind-Clouding** prevents your target from being aware that he’s being tailed, and grants its level to all **Shadowing** rolls.  **Telereceive**, if you’re connected to your target, lets you know where your target is going and grants a +4 to **Shadowing** rolls.

If your target has active, power-consuming technology, **Electric Vision** grants a +4 to detect him at a glance.
